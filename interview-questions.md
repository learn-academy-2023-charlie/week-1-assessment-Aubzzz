# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a software created to make sharing coding practices/products easier and Github is the platform that Git is utilized on.

Researched answer: 
-Git is a version control system. This helps track changes made in code, offers the capability of branches, ensures faster/more efficient ways to manage coding in projects of alls sizes. Git also features the capability of having multiple branches that are not connected to one another, so modifying/deleting one branch will not affect another.(https://git-scm.com/)
-GitHub is a developer platform that is open source, allows developers to build projects, edit them and share them. It also offers resources such as "how-to" guides, templates for different languages and extensions to download to assist users. A project can be made public or private. For a profile, you can receive access to more features and applications if you pay a monthly fee on a tiered pricing scale, however there is a free version. A user's profile will track commits, pushes ando other contributions made. A profile also has a "feed" that shows their activity in repositories and contributions, followers, and most actively used repositories.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: = , ===, /=, >=, <=. 

Researched answer: Answer also includes || and &&. 
    -Researched and summarized from "https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_booleans.asp"
    - Boolean values dictate whether a variable or expression is true/false. They are utilized in comparison and conditionals statements that allow the output to show if the expression/variable entered is true or false. True or false can look like 1 === 1 (true) or 2 > 105(false). If an boolean variable has a value, it is true and if it does not have a value it is false (w3schools.com/js/js_booleans.asp). Boolean will also return false if it is undefined, Nan, Null, 0, or -0.(https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/javascript/javascript-boolean)

3. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An array's value is stored in a single variable, so it will be an entire index.
    Example. ["computer", "cat", "dinner", "trees"]
        Index:   0          1        2         3
    In a regular string, each character of the value would be it's own index.
    Example: ("puppies)
    Index: 6- 0/p, 1/u, 2/p, etc.
   

Researched answer: 
-"The index of a value in an array, is that value's location within an array" (https://problemsolvingwithpython.com/05-NumPy-and-Arrays/05.05-Array-Indexing/#:~:text=The%20index%20of%20a%20value,in%20the%20code%20section%20below.&text=The%20array%20above%20contains%20three%20values%3A%202%20%2C%204%20and%206%20.) Each element in the array list can be accessed through indexing.
