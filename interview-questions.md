    -Researched and summarized from "https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_booleans.asp"
    - Boolean values dictate whether a variable or expression is true/false. They are utilized in comparison and conditionals statements that allow the output to show if the expression/variable entered is true or false. True or false can look like 1 === 1 (true) or 2 > 105(false). If an expression has a value, it is true and if it does not have a value it is false (w3schools.com/js/js_booleans.asp).

1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An array's value will be an entire index.
    Example. ["computer", "cat", "dinner", "trees"]
        Index:   0          1        2         3
    In a regular string, each character of the value would be it's own index.
    Example: ("puppies)
    Index: 6- 0/p, 1/u, 2/p, etc.
